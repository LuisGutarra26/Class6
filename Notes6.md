1. Key facts from reading and watching videos were from learning confidentially, integrity, availblity, and safety, learning the essential elements of IAM, and learning the IAM features.

2. Here are all my interesting quotes: "An IAM user is a person or application that is defined in an AWS account, and that must make API calls to AWS products. Each user must have a unique name (with no spaces in the name) within the AWS account, and a set of security credentials that is not shared with other users." I chose that because you wouldn't want anyone hacking your information. Quote 2: "You can use the AWS command line tools to issue commands at your system's command line to perform IAM and AWS tasks. Using the command line can be faster and more convenient than the console." I want to be fimilar while with IAM myself for these next weeks of class to understand IAM more. Finally quote 3, "Your root account credentials identify you to services in AWS and grant you unlimited use of your AWS resources. The AWS Management Console requires your username and password so that the service can determine whether you have permission to access its resources." I'm well aware that any service cab give you a hard time to access via permission, so that's why I quoted that.

3. New facts I found interesting were learning AWS KMS is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, SAML is an open standard for exchanging identity and security information with applications and service providers, and lastly AWS Shield Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks that target your web site or applications.
